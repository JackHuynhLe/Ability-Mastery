# Ability Mastery

**Ability Mastery** is a web-based game inspired by League of Legends. In this game, players must match the correct abilities to their respective champions. In each round, a randomly selected champion appears with their signature abilities (Passive, Q, W, E, R) and a set of fake abilities. The playerâ€™s goal is to drag and drop the correct abilities into their corresponding slots.

### Key Features:
- **Random Champion Selection**: Each session features a random champion from League of Legends.
- **Drag-and-Drop Mechanics**: Players can drag abilities and drop them into the correct Q, W, E, and R slots.
- **Interactive UI**: Simple yet engaging interface featuring champion images and ability slots.
- **Challenge Mode**: Fake abilities are included, making it harder to identify the correct abilities for each champion.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML** for the structure and content of the game.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for the game logic, drag-and-drop functionality, and dynamic fetching of champion data using the League of Legends API.
- **Riot Games API** to retrieve champion and ability data.

### Live Demo:
The game is hosted live on **Netlify** at [Ability Mastery](https://abilitymastery.netlify.app/).
